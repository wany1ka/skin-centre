            <h3>PRP INJECTIONS AND TREATMENT</h3>  
            <p>What Can Platelet-Rich Plasma Treat (PRP)? <span id="cut1">...</span> <span id="more1" style="display: none;">
              In Nairobi, Kenya, Skin Centre by Dr Wanyika - the Skin Specialists - administer PRP Injections to patients with the need to speed healing wounds after injury or surgery for certain conditions, particularly sports related injuries.
              Platelets, once injected into the area that requires treatment, breaks down and releases growth factors, which are compounds that help cells repair and renew as well as skin rejuvenation needs.
              PRP injection also curb pain and boost mobility with injuries. In addition to helping injured tissue heal, some studies show PRP injections curb pain and boost mobility for people with rotator cuff injuries.
              PRP injections are used to treat torn tendons, tendinitis, ligaments, muscle injuries, arthritis-related pain, skin, joint injuries and also to reduce hair loss in people with male or female pattern baldness.
               Dr Hannah Wanyika, the dermatologist, administers PRP Injections for cosmetic procedures to treat a type of hair loss called androgenic alopecia, also known as male or female pattern baldness, which affects men and women.
               We also use PRP injections as a cosmetic procedure to manage signs of aging, such as wrinkles on our clients.

          <h3>CRYOTHERAPY TREATMENT</h3>
          <p> Also known as Cryosurgery or skin tag removal, <span id="cut4">...</span> <span id="more4"  style="display: none;">Cryotherapy is effective in the removal of abnormal skin cells through applying extremely cold liquid or instrument by dermatologists and primary care doctors to significantly lower the air temperature around the patient to promote of the wellness and beauty to new heights.
    
            We apply Cryotherapy to freeze and destroy targeted skin growths while preserving the surrounding skin, eliminate aches and pains from suffered injuries (both recent and old), skin disorders, cellulite, saggy skin as well as those seeking to prevent full body ageing. This medical procedure is usually employed to destroy a variety of benign skin growths, such as warts and age spots, pre-cancerous lesions like actinic keratoses, and malignant lesions such as basal cell and squamous cell cancers.
            
            Cryotherapy is greatly beneficial since it reduces migraine symptoms, numbs nerve irritation, reduces arthritic pain, may help treat low-risk tumors, helps prevent dementia and Alzheimer's disease, treats atopic dermatitis and other skin conditions and helps treat mood disorders.
            
            Cryotherapy poses little risk to elderly and other patients who may not be good candidates for other surgical procedures since it does not pose the risk of scarring, infection, and damage to underlying skin and tissue. Let us give you medicallyand cosmetically safe Cyotherapy treatment. </span></p>
